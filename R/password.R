#' @title Random Password Generation
#' 
#' @description Generates character strings for use as passwords.  
#' 
#' @param n \code{numeric(1)}, number of characters in the desired password.
#' @param digits \code{logical(1)}, should the digits \code{0:9} be included
#'   in the character pool?
#' @param upperalpha \code{logical(1)}, should the upper case alphabet 
#'   \code{LETTERS} be included in the character pool.
#' @param loweralpha \code{logical(1)}, should the lower case alphabet
#'   \code{letters} be included in the character pool.
#' @param special A character vector of special characters to include in the 
#'   character pool.  If special characters should not be considered, provide
#'   either \code{character(0)} or \code{NULL}.
#' @param replace \code{logical(1)}, should sampling from the character pool 
#'   be done with replacement?
#' @param digit_first_allowed \code{logical(1)}, is it allowable for the first
#'   character in the password to be a digit?
#' @param one_from_each \code{logical(1)}, is it mandatory that at least one 
#'   from each character set be selected?
#'
#' @section Functional Requirements:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item User may designate the length of the password.
#'   \item User may include or exclude digits from the character pool.
#'   \item User may include or exclude lower case letters from the character pool.
#'   \item User may include or exclude upper case letters from the character pool.
#'   \item User may designate which, if any, special character to include in the character pool.
#'   \item Sampling may be done with or without replacement.
#'   \item User may disallow the first character from being a digit
#'   \item The user may require that at least one character from each character set is included.
#'   \item The output has exactly as many character as \code{n}
#'   \item The output is a \code{character(1)}
#' }
