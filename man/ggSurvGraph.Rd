\usage{
ggSurvGraph(object, times, cum.inc = FALSE, conf.bar = TRUE,
  conf.band = FALSE, censor.mark = FALSE, offset.scale = 1,
  n.risk = FALSE, n.event = FALSE, gg_expr, give_me = "plot")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted survival object, such as a survfit model or a data
frame containing the information for the graph. If a data frame, the
columns must be named time, surv, lower, upper, n.risk, n.event, group.
(see details for more information).}

\item{times}{Vector of times at which confidence bars should be drawn.
Defaults to all event times.}

\item{cum.inc}{If \code{TRUE}, a cumulative incidence plot is drawn instead
of a survival plot.}

\item{conf.bar}{If \code{TRUE}, vertical bars denoting the confidence
limits are drawn.}

\item{conf.band}{If \code{TRUE}, confidence bands denoting the confidence
limits are drawn.  These are drawn with \code{ggplot2} parameters
\code{alpha=0.5, linetype=0}.  Changing these values requires manually
adding a \code{geom_rect} call to \code{gg_expr}.  See the examples for
how to do this.}

\item{censor.mark}{If \code{TRUE} points on the curves are added to denote
where censored values occur.  These are drawn with \code{ggplot2}
parameters \code{symbol="+", size=5}.  Changing these values requires
manually adding a \code{geom_point} call to \code{gg_expr}.  See the
examples for how to do this.}

\item{offset.scale}{the scale of time units to offset the bars from the
specified interval. For example, if a bar should be placed at 25 months,
and scale=.5, the bars will be placed at 24.5 and 25.5 months. If scale=1,
the bars will be placed at 24 months and 26 months. Additional groups are
placed further out on the same scale}

\item{n.risk}{A logical indicating whether the number of subjects at
risk should be printed at the bottom of the graph. Defaults to \code{FALSE}
for no printing.}

\item{n.event}{A logical indicating whether the cumulative number of events
should be printed at the bottom of the graph. Defaults to \code{FALSE}
for no printing.}

\item{gg_expr}{A list of expressions to be added to the initial \code{ggplot}
command.}

\item{give_me}{A character vector that controls the output of the function.
  By default, only the plot is returned.  The user may request any combination
  of \code{"plot"}, the survival plot; \code{"survRaw"}, the raw data for the
  complete survival curve; and \code{"survData"}, the reduced data for
  plotting confidence bars.}
}
\description{
Creates a graph of one or more survival curves with vertical
  bars to represent confidence intervals. Uses the \code{ggplot} system
  instead of base graphics.
}
\details{
The function plots the Kaplan-Meier survival curves of the provided
  object or data. It then places vertical bars the length of the confidence
  interval at that point at the distances specified by span.

  \code{ggSurvGraph} operates my creating a data frame of values to be
  plotted, even if a survfit object is passed to the function. Thus,
  \code{ggSurvGraph} does not utilize the options in \code{plot.survfit}.
  Those accustomed to plotting Kaplan-Meier curves with \code{plot.survfit}
  will not necessarily get the same results with \code{ggSurvGraph}.

  When a data frame is passed to \code{ggSurvGraph} the columns of data
  must have the named elements:
  \code{time, surv, lower, upper, n.risk, n.event [,strata]}, where
  \tabular{ll}{
    \code{time}  \tab denotes the survival time\cr
    \code{surv}  \tab denotes the probability of survival at \code{time}\cr
    \code{lower} \tab denotes the lower confidence limit for \code{surv}\cr
    \code{upper} \tab denotes the upper confidence limit for \code{surv}\cr
    \code{n.risk}\tab denotes the number at risk at \code{time}\cr
    \code{n.event}\tab denotes the number of events occuring between \code{time}
      and the previous \code{time}.\cr
    \code{strata}\tab is an optional variable that allows for simultaneous plotting of stratified
      survival curves.  Each observation in the data set should have a group
      associated with it if \code{group} is supplied.\cr
  }

  \code{SurvGraph} is not capable of handling cox models.
}
\section{Internal Data}{

Additional layers may be added to the plot using the \code{gg_expr}
argument.  The layers should use the data produced internal to the function.
There are two data sets created.  \code{survRaw} is generated from the
output of \code{summary(object)} without a \code{times} argument.  The
Kaplan-Meier curve is based on this data frame as it contains the information
for the full curve.  A second data frame, called \code{survData}, is generated
from the output of \code{summary(object, times=[times])} and is used to
draw the confidence bars.

Contents of \code{survRaw}
\itemize{
  \item{time} The time elapsed since the index time
  \item{n.risk} The number at risk at time
  \item{n.event} The number of events between time[t-1] and time[t].
  \item{n.censor} The number of censored observations between time[t-1] and time[t]
  \item{surv} The survival proportion at time[t]
  \item{lower} The lower confidence limit of survival at time[t]
  \item{upper} The upper confidence limit of survival at time[t]
  \item{strata} Group assignment
  \item{cum.evt} The cumulative events at time[t]
  \item{next.time} The next observed time in the object.  This is useful for
    plotting confidence bands.
}

The contents \code{survData} are identical, except it lacks the \code{next.time}
variable.
