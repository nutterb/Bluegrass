Data are extracted from the World Health Organization (WHO) website (see link below).  
  The link to download the MS Excel sheet is under the "Methodological aspects and other analysis"
  and titled "Weight percentiles calculator."

\usage{
percentile_weight_gest_age(weeks, weight, less = TRUE, direction = FALSE,
  result = c("ptile", "code", "desc"))
}
\arguments{
\item{weeks}{Weeks gestational age (as an integer)}

\item{weight}{Weight in grams}

\item{less}{Logical.  Determines if the percentile returned should be read as
"less than [percentile]" or "greater than [percentile]"}

\item{direction}{Logical. Should an inequality symbol be printed with the
result to indicate the direction.  See Examples.}

\item{result}{A character specifying how the results should be returned.
\code{"ptile"} results in the numeric percentile value being returned; 
\code{"code"} returns the percentile code; and
\code{"desc"} returns the percentile description.  These values are
represented by the \code{percentile}, \code{percentile_code}, and
\code{percentile_desc} fields, respectively, in the \code{GestAgeWtPercentile}
data set.}
}
\description{
Reference a birth weight for gestational age to the 
  World Health Organization growth tables.
}
\section{Functional Requirements}{

Use World Health Organization reports for the basis of evaluation.

\enumerate{
  \item Accepts the number of weeks gestational age and the fetal weight
        in grams as numeric values.
  \item Provides options to return output as a numeric value or a 
        character value.
}

\examples{
#* Results can be read as "less than 75th percentile" (for example) 
percentile_weight_gest_age(weeks = c(30, 34, 36),
                           weight = c(1500, 2500, 2000))

#* Same results, but with directional indicator
percentile_weight_gest_age(weeks = c(30, 34, 36),
                           weight = c(1500, 2500, 2000),
                           direction=TRUE)

#* Same results, but with directional indicator
#* and percentile description
percentile_weight_gest_age(weeks = c(30, 34, 36),
                           weight = c(1500, 2500, 2000),
                           direction=TRUE,
                           result="desc")
