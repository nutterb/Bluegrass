\description{
Running a function like \code{univariable_table} has the 
  potential to produce several warnings, but can do so while making it 
  difficult to determine which of the variable tests generated the 
  warning.  This captures the warning without casting it so the warnings 
  can all be gathered and printed at the same time.
